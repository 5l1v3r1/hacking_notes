# CRYPTOGRAPHY

XOR
===

The binary operation XOR (stands for eXclusive OR) is a binary operand (as are AND, OR, etc) from Boole algebra. This operand will compare two bits and will produce one bit in return. That bit will be equal to 1 if the two compared bits were different, 0 if they were equal.


Simple types of ciphers (just substituted lettters or moved down the alphabet):

Caesar's Cypher
ROT13

Useful tool for automatically decoding ciphers (cryptogram solver):

might be useful sometimes, for example, displays all 26 shifts:
